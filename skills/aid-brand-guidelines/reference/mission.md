AID is a cross-organizational unit within CyberAgent — not a product team, but a transformation office that works across all divisions.

## Vision

> エンジニアとAIエージェントが協働し、革新的な開発組織へアップデートする

Engineers and AI agents collaborate together, updating toward an innovative development organization.

## Mission

Transform all of CyberAgent into an "AI-native organization" — targeting +50% development productivity and 90%+ AI adoption. Drive AI transformation across three layers: Organization, Individual, and Culture.

## Three Pillars

### 1. Culture (文化醸成)

AI協働文化の構築 — Building an AI collaboration culture.

- AI events, recognition programs, public communications
- Coordination with CTO office (エキスパート, JBアップデート, etc.)
- Positively embrace change during this critical transition period

### 2. Organization (組織)

Product maturity measurement and development flow modernization.

- Measurement → エンジニア版AI番付 (Engineer AI Rankings)
- Development workflow updates
- AI knowledge sharing across teams
- Focus on departments with lower adoption (identify via AI習熟度/AI番付)

### 3. Individual (個人)

Personal skill development and opportunity creation.

- Measurement → Individual proficiency tracking
- Reskilling programs and hands-on workshops
- Growth path for engineers in the AI era

## Key Messaging Principles

### 納得感と自分ごと化 (Conviction & Personal Ownership)

This is the central communication principle. When driving company-wide initiatives:

- **納得感 (Conviction)**: The "why" must be clear. Use CABC and company-level messaging to create shared understanding among all engineers.
- **自分ごと化 (Personal ownership)**: Go beyond just executing initiatives — frame them with meaning so people feel "I need to do this too." Include accountability for business leaders and managers.

### Tone

- Positive about change — frame AI transformation as an exciting opportunity, not a threat
- Inclusive — bridge the gap between active adopters and hesitant teams
- Concrete — ground vision in measurable outcomes (productivity metrics, adoption rates)
- Collaborative — engineers *with* AI agents, not replaced by them

## Logo Concept: AI := Driven

### 価値の再定義 (Redefining Value)

The logo questions and redefines the value of engineering in the AI era. It represents the stance of continuously updating organizational standards — examining and reconstructing assumptions about technology and processes to sustain growth in a rapidly changing environment.

### `:=` as Symbol

`:=` represents definition and assignment — a statement of continuously redefining values. The organization's commitment to ongoing evolution.

### Temperature Rising

The blue-to-red gradient represents thoughts and emotions heating up — from cool analysis to warm action.

### Driven (突き動かされる力)

The shadow extending from the dot symbolizes the driving force — the strong will that serves as the origin point of action.

### Expandable Format

- **AI := Driven** — Main logo
- **AI := ___** — Template for campaigns (e.g., "AI := Innovation")
- **Engineer := ___** — Engineer context
- **Developer := ___** — Developer context
