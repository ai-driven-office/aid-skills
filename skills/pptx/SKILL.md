## Editing Workflow

**Read [editing.md](editing.md) for full details.**

1. Analyze template with `thumbnail.py`
2. Unpack → manipulate slides → edit content → clean → pack

## Design Ideas

**Don't create boring slides.** Plain bullets on a white background won't impress anyone. Consider ideas from this list for each slide.

### Before Starting

- **Pick a bold, content-informed color palette**: The palette should feel designed for THIS topic. If swapping your colors into a completely different presentation would still "work," you haven't made specific enough choices.
- **Dominance over equality**: One color should dominate (60-70% visual weight), with 1-2 supporting tones and one sharp accent. Never give all colors equal weight.
- **Dark/light contrast**: Dark backgrounds for title + conclusion slides, light for content ("sandwich" structure). Or commit to dark throughout for a premium feel.
- **Commit to a visual motif**: Pick ONE distinctive element and repeat it — rounded image frames, icons in colored circles, thick single-side borders. Carry it across every slide.

### Color Palettes (Spindle Design System)

CyberAgent's official Spindle design system palettes. Note: PPTX hex codes omit the `#` prefix.

| Theme | Primary | Secondary | Accent | Background | Text |
|-------|---------|-----------|--------|------------|------|
| **Ameba Green** | `2d8c3c` | `e7f5e9` | `82be28` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Deep Green** | `0f5c1f` | `c6e5c9` | `298737` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Fresh Lime** | `82be28` | `f0f7e6` | `477d00` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Uranai Purple** | `391e66` | `eee8f4` | `743faa` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Ocean Digital** | `203957` | `e3f4fa` | `4da2d6` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Teal Growth** | `003d2c` | `e0f5f1` | `00a688` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Neutral Pro** | `08121a` | `f5f6f6` | `2d8c3c` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Dark Mode** | `08121a` | `141e25` | `41ad4f` | `08121a` | `ffffff` |
| **Warm Sunset** | `8a2701` | `f6e7e5` | `de4d14` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |
| **Vibrant Pink** | `630f33` | `fce4e9` | `e02c53` | `ffffff` | `08121a` |

### For Each Slide

**Every slide needs a visual element** — image, chart, icon, or shape. Text-only slides are forgettable.

**Layout options:**
- Two-column (text left, illustration on right)
- Icon + text rows (icon in colored circle, bold header, description below)
- 2x2 or 2x3 grid (image on one side, grid of content blocks on other)
- Half-bleed image (full left or right side) with content overlay

**Data display:**
- Large stat callouts (big numbers 60-72pt with small labels below)
- Comparison columns (before/after, pros/cons, side-by-side options)
- Timeline or process flow (numbered steps, arrows)

**Visual polish:**
- Icons in small colored circles next to section headers
- Italic accent text for key stats or taglines

### Typography (CyberAgent/Spindle)

**For Japanese content:**

| Element | Font | Size |
|---------|------|------|
| Slide Title | Meiryo (Bold) | 36-44pt |
| Section Header | Meiryo (Bold) | 20-24pt |
| Body Text | Meiryo | 14-16pt |
| Captions | Meiryo | 10-12pt |
| Fallback | Yu Gothic Medium, system-ui | — |

**For English content:**

| Element | Font | Size |
|---------|------|------|
| Slide Title | Arial Black | 36-44pt |
| Section Header | Calibri Bold | 20-24pt |
| Body Text | Calibri | 14-16pt |
| Captions | Calibri | 10-12pt |

**Additional pairings:**

| Header Font | Body Font |
|-------------|-----------|
| Meiryo Bold | Meiryo |
| Arial Black | Calibri |
| Calibri Bold | Calibri Light |
| Georgia | Calibri |

### Spacing

- 0.5" minimum margins
- 0.3-0.5" between content blocks
- Leave breathing room—don't fill every inch

### Avoid (Common Mistakes)

- **Don't repeat the same layout** — vary columns, cards, and callouts across slides
- **Don't center body text** — left-align paragraphs and lists; center only titles
- **Don't skimp on size contrast** — titles need 36pt+ to stand out from 14-16pt body
- **Don't default to blue** — pick colors that reflect the specific topic
- **Don't mix spacing randomly** — choose 0.3" or 0.5" gaps and use consistently
- **Don't style one slide and leave the rest plain** — commit fully or keep it simple throughout
- **Don't create text-only slides** — add images, icons, charts, or visual elements; avoid plain title + bullets
- **Don't forget text box padding** — when aligning lines or shapes with text edges, set `margin: 0` on the text box or offset the shape to account for padding
- **Don't use low-contrast elements** — icons AND text need strong contrast against the background; avoid light text on light backgrounds or dark text on dark backgrounds
- **NEVER use accent lines under titles** — these are a hallmark of AI-generated slides; use whitespace or background color instead

## QA (Required)

**Assume there are problems. Your job is to find them.**

Your first render is almost never correct. Approach QA as a bug hunt, not a confirmation step. If you found zero issues on first inspection, you weren't looking hard enough.

### Content QA

```bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx
```

Check for missing content, typos, wrong order.

**When using templates, check for leftover placeholder text:**

```bash
python -m markitdown output.pptx | grep -iE "xxxx|lorem|ipsum|this.*(page|slide).*layout"
```

If grep returns results, fix them before declaring success.

### Visual QA

**⚠️ USE SUBAGENTS** — even for 2-3 slides. You've been staring at the code and will see what you expect, not what's there. Subagents have fresh eyes.

Convert slides to images (see [Converting to Images](#converting-to-images)), then use this prompt:

```
Visually inspect these slides. Assume there are issues — find them.

Look for:
- Overlapping elements (text through shapes, lines through words, stacked elements)
- Text overflow or cut off at edges/box boundaries
- Decorative lines positioned for single-line text but title wrapped to two lines
- Source citations or footers colliding with content above
- Elements too close (< 0.3" gaps) or cards/sections nearly touching
- Uneven gaps (large empty area in one place, cramped in another)
- Insufficient margin from slide edges (< 0.5")
- Columns or similar elements not aligned consistently
- Low-contrast text (e.g., light gray text on cream-colored background)
- Low-contrast icons (e.g., dark icons on dark backgrounds without a contrasting circle)
- Text boxes too narrow causing excessive wrapping
- Leftover placeholder content

For each slide, list issues or areas of concern, even if minor.

Read and analyze these images:
1. /path/to/slide-01.jpg (Expected: [brief description])
2. /path/to/slide-02.jpg (Expected: [brief description])

Report ALL issues found, including minor ones.
```

### Verification Loop

1. Generate slides → Convert to images → Inspect
2. **List issues found** (if none found, look again more critically)
3. Fix issues
4. **Re-verify affected slides** — one fix often creates another problem
5. Repeat until a full pass reveals no new issues

**Do not declare success until you've completed at least one fix-and-verify cycle.**

## Converting to Images

Convert presentations to individual slide images for visual inspection:

```bash
python scripts/office/soffice.py --headless --convert-to pdf output.pptx
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 output.pdf slide
```

This creates `slide-01.jpg`, `slide-02.jpg`, etc.

To re-render specific slides after fixes:

```bash
pdftoppm -jpeg -r 150 -f N -l N output.pdf slide-fixed
```
